        <h1>Brief History of Sabaton's Greatness</h1>
        <p>
             In the nearly two decades since their launch, Swedish metallers <br>
             Sabaton have carved out a reputation as one of the hardest <br>
             working bands in the business – gaining a legion of loyal fans <br>
             across the globe, delivering eight highly-rated studio albums <br>
             (including two certified platinum-sellers), and scoring multiple industry award wins and nominations… not to mention <br>
             launching their own annual festival and cruise.
        </p>

        <p>
             Combining soaring power riffs with vocalist Joakim Brodén’s <br>
             instantly-recognisable gruff baritone, the band refuses to be <br>
             simply slotted into a genre. Fans need only know them as <br>
             Sabaton: the heavy metal band that sings of real life wars and <br>
             the people who played a part in them – of gruelling campaigns <br>
             and dazzling acts of bravery, of magnificent victories and <br>
             touching personal struggles – true stories more fantastic than <br>
             any fiction.
